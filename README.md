Android Development Project – Registration Form
This project demonstrates a key feature of an Android application: a User Registration Form. The form is designed to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience for new users to sign up for the app.

Features
User Input Validation: The form ensures that all fields are filled correctly, validating user inputs such as email, password, and phone number formats.
Real-Time Error Handling: As users enter information, errors are displayed in real-time, guiding users to correct their inputs before submission.
Secure Password Handling: Password strength is checked, and the input is masked for security.
Responsive UI: The form is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
API Integration: Upon successful validation, the user’s data is securely sent to a backend API for registration and account creation (simulation).
Feedback System: Users receive instant feedback on the success or failure of their registration attempt.
Technologies Used
Android SDK
Java (or Kotlin, depending on the language used)
XML for UI Design
Retrofit for API communication
Validation Libraries for form validation..
Future Improvements
Add OAuth support for social login (Google, Facebook).
Enhance UI with Material Design components.
Implement two-factor authentication for added security.
